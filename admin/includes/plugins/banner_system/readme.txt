The newsletter system allows your visitors to sign-up for a newsletter and it allows the administrator via HTML templates to setup newsletters and send them to the visitors.<br />
On the administrator end, assigned visitors can be seen via their e-mail. Newletter templates can be loaded, edited and save as files. A word processor interface is included via a jscript editor.<br />
For the web-front, the system offers the option to assign dedicated newsletters to different text pages so when the visitor signs up the details of the page are also included.
