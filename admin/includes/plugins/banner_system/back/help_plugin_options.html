<h2>Banner System - Plugin Options</h2>
<p>There are different display and configuration options to allow banners to display on certain parts of the front-end.</p>
<p>Depending on the banner group each banner is assigned into, the banner resource will show only if the corresponding location is enabled. The left/right, top and bottom sections of the website can be enabled or disabled here.</p>
<p>A default relative path where banner images will be uploaded is also included. The path is applicable for newly created banners. Paths of existing banners maintain the previously setup path. Therefore multiple folders can be setup for banner storage.</p>
<p>The plugin includes two separate monitoring options to record banner displaying and banner clicks. When these options are set, access of the banners is recorded and displayed with the banners listing.</p>
<p>Click the <b>confirm</b> button to update these options or <b>cancel</b> to go back to the main plugins list page.</p>
