<h2>Text Pages Assignment</h2>
<p>The list of entries here shows the text pages associated with the download system. 
Marked entries indicate the text pages will show on the web-front with a download link or button as long as the entry is enabled.</p>
<p>A text page can have multiple downloads and therefore the <b>instances</b> column represents the number of files a text page has as downloads. 
Download files can be grouped into a single section by having a description filled in for one entry and leaving the rest of descriptions blank. 
The order in which the downloads are listed instructs the system how to display the downloads and 
also allows mixed combinations of populated and empty description fields to create different sections.</p>
<p>To confirm a new assignment <b>tick the checboxes</b> first then hit the <b>update</b> button. Also note this is not the page from where you can delete assigned text pages of the download system. 
Deleting assigned page can be achieved from the main download page. To go back to the main download page hit the <b>back</b> button.</p>
