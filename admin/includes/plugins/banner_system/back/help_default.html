<h2>Download Management</h2>
<p>The download plugin assigns files to collections and text pages. Multiple downloads can be enabled
at any time using the assignment switches. Depending on the configuration of the plugins a download
form can appear on the web-front as the visitor views the web page.
The download plugin emits a post form or a direct link with the content of the assigned pages. Associated files can be
then downloaded.</p>
<p>One download file is allowed per entry but multiple download files for the same entry can be achieved with the use of instances. 
To assign multiple files go to the text pages or collection section by clicking 
the <b>Re-Assign Text Pages</b> or <b>Re-Assign Content Collectons</b> color legends and then selecting again the same entries. 
You can then upload another file, enter another description and title.</p>
<p>You can group multiple downloads together by setting the order of the first to a low number and populate its description. 
The rest of the downloads can have their description empty and they will be grouped into a single section when viewing the downloads from the web-front. 
Combinations of download sections can be achieved by using the sort order and populating description fields for the first entry of each section.</p>
