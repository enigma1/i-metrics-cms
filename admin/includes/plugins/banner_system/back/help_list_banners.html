<h2>Banners Management</h2>
<p>
The list of entries here shows the existing banners of your site. Each banner allocates a single entry and can be assigned to text or collection pages. 
A banner has an enabled/disabled control switch, an assigned banner group that includes other general properties like dimensions, a stand alone link 
and an image or media that represents the banner itself.
</p>
<h2>Editing Banners</h2>
<div class="floater"><img src="includes/plugins/banner_system/back/banner_edit.png" title="Editing Banners" alt="Editing Banners" /></div><div class="hideover">When editing a banner the aforementioned properties can change. In addition there are several configuration options which are explained here.
In particular the combinations of content ID and content type. When using content ID of 0 the content type has the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>When the content type is 0 the banner is displayed on all pages.</li>
<li>When the content type is 1 the banner is displayd on all text pages.</li>
<li>When the content type is 2 the banner is displayd on all collections.</li>
</ul>
When the content ID contains a non-zero value it points to a text or collection page subject to the content type.

<h2>Assigning pages to banners</h2>
<p>When a banner is not a global one it is assigned solely to text page or collection page. In this case the banner creation occurs directly
via the text or collection assignment. There is no need to create the banner via the <b>new</b> links or buttons.</p>
<p>If a text page or collection has already banners assigned those pages are highlighted with a different color during assignment. 
A page may have multiple banners assigned but the same banner cannot be assigned to multiple text or collection pages unless it's a global one. 
Global banners operate on all text or oll collection pages or on every page of the CMS.</p>
<h2>Deleting Banners</h2>
<p>To delete the existing banners directly from the list, <b>tick the checboxes</b> first then hit the <b>delete</b> button. 
A confirmation page will appear from where you need to confirm deletion of the selected banners. Images stored on the server will also be removed. 
Also note this is not the page from where you can delete assigned text pages of the download system. 
Deleting assigned page can be achieved from the main download page. To go back to the main download page hit the <b>back</b> button.</p>
