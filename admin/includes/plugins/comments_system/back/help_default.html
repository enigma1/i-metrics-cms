<h2>Comments System</h2>
<p>The comments plugin assigns a form to collections and text pages so visitor may post comments. 
The administrator has several options to activate the plugin exclusively on text pages or on the different collections. Comments may automatically approved or wait for administrator approval. All these options can be setup from the plugins manager.</p>
<p>Spam protection options are also included where a series of hidden buttons are exposed with the comments form to ensure human presence when the comments form is posted.</p>
<p>A rating configuration option is also available where visitors may give a grade to text page or collection they post their comment for.</p>
<p>The main comments script is available under the Site Content section, incorporates a comments listing and assignment of text pages and collections.</p>
<p>Each comment can be approved, edited or deleted by the administrator. To modify a comment, select the comment from the main comments list and then click the edit icon or button on the right side of the page.</p>
<p>For each comment entry there are individual icons to preview, delete, edit or select a comment for additional information. The status lamps operate separately and indicate whether a comment is approved or not.</p>
<p>To delete comments, tick the comment entries then hit the delete button. There will be no confirmation for the mass delete comments operation. There is a confirmation dialog that appears on the right, for the individual comments delete option.</p>
<p>To assign or exclude a text page from comments click the <b>Re-Assign Text Pages</b> box and mark the appropriate entries. Finally hit the update button to confirm the assignment.</p>
